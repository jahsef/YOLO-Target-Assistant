minimum frames to target (currently have the config for this, but doesnt do anything in code) (lower prio tbh)
    n frames before lock, reactivated tracks should not have this requirement
    or just n frames before right clicking (this solves the zoom issue close range, but see other zoom thing)

base zoom + other zoom modes, we can define multiple zoom modes (very nice for usability)
    linear warmup over n frames (user defined too) to full zoom, makes it so the aimbot doesnt flick above a target with high zoom mode as soon as you right click


tracker from scratch (but actually follow through this time) (would need to do on gpu to make it worth)
