fix right click toggle logic lol currently the right click toggle off doesnt even work?
also make dpg overlay force refresh on a timer rather than on num of frames passed

minimum frames to target (currently have the config for this, but doesnt do anything in code):
    n frames before lock, reactivated tracks should not have this requirement

prioritization by track age

tracker from scratch (but actually follow through this time)
